<h3 class="text-center"><b> TIMELINE FOR SIGN UPS </b> <br></h3>
<p>
  <b> Wednesday, February 19: </b> the UAID website will launch so students can view ALL available sessions. 
Friday, February 21 at 7am: Students can start signing up for UAID sessions on Sched 
Friday, February 21, we will extend 3rd period 8 minutes beyond Kickin' It so that students who didn’t sign up early can sign up. Kickin it will do a live demonstration. We’ll also have UA Idea Day staff in the hallways to pop into classrooms to answer any questions or make recommendations!
Thursday, February 27 at 3pm: The sign up window closes. No one will be able to sign up after 3pm.
Friday, February 28: If you have successfully enrolled in either a field trip or get on the field trip waitlist, we will print a permission slip with a barcode assigned to you. 
March 6th at the end of 5th period: the last day/period to turn in a permission form

SIGNUPS:
This year we will be piloting a new platform for signups called Sched.
Account sign in information will be the same as PowerSchool.
We will link Sched to our website and we will link our website to Sched. 
Additionally, we’ll push out a UA Idea Day app to make sign ups easier.
The icon will look like the image on the right:   
Once you sign up, you can access your schedule anytime, with all session details included.
Session types will be color-coded:
2.5 hour workshops are colored purple
1 hour sprints are colored yellow
½ day field trips are light blue
Full day workshops are pink
Full day field trips are dark blue
Once you click on a session you are in it. There is NO SUBMIT BUTTON. If you try to choose a session that does not fit into your schedule, you will be prompted to choose something else.
Make sure you fill your schedule! Otherwise we will auto-assign you to a session.
Last year, some of the students who chose two field trips were late to the afternoon experience. For that reason, we ask you to choose only one field trip. 



TYPES OF SESSIONS STUDENTS CAN CHOOSE

To help think through how to set up a day, here are the 10 possible combinations:

AM: 2 sprint sessions; PM: 2 sprint sessions (TOTAL: 4 sessions)
AM: 1 workshop; PM: 2 sprint sessions (TOTAL: 3 sessions)
AM: 2 sprint sessions; PM: 1 workshop (TOTAL: 3 sessions)
AM: 2 sprint sessions; PM: 1 field trip (TOTAL: 3 sessions)
AM: 1 field trip; PM: 2 sprint sessions (TOTAL: 3 sessions)
AM: 1 field trip; PM: 1 workshop (TOTAL: 2 sessions)
AM: 1 workshop; PM: 1 field trip (TOTAL: 2 sessions)
AM: 1 workshop; PM: 1 workshop (TOTAL: 2 sessions)
AM & PM:  full day field trip (TOTAL: 1 session)
AM & PM: full day workshop (TOTAL: 1 session)

FIELD TRIPS & PERMISSION FORMS
In the week leading up to UAID 2019, we were missing nearly 200 permission forms, so this year the turnaround for turning in Field Trip permission slips will be tight and we will have a waitlist. 

To ensure the bus departures happen on time, you may only attend ONE field trip. If you sign up for two, you will be removed from the trip with the most people on the waitlist.

We will print a permission form with a barcode for all students who have enrolled in a field trip or who are listed as one of the top 10 spots on the field trip waitlist. Students should turn in permission forms in person Monday, March 2 through Friday, March 6 during 4th and 5th period. NO emailed forms, forms left on chairs, or forms placed in mailboxes will be accepted. Anyone who has not turned in a permission form by March 6th at the end of 5th period will be removed from the field trip and/or field trip waitlist.

WHAT TO EXPECT IN THE MORNING:
Please scan in with your school ID at the senior lot doors or the Bear doors. 
Presenters, facilitators and guests will have a special check in at the doors by the main office; to avoid congestion, we are asking students to scan in at one of the other two doors. 
We will open the auditorium at 7:50 am, and begin our program promptly at 8:05 am. 
Seats will be first come, first served. UAID student leaders will be planning an opening countdown. We will also have a special guest to set your frame of mind around the theme: Kaleidoscope: A New Perspective. Once all of the auditorium seats are taken, we will direct students to the overflow area in the cafeteria. You’re not going to want to miss our opening gig, so come early and sit close. 
Lunch will be closed, but we are planning a fashion show in the LC, food services will be offering pre-orders so you can avoid lines, and we will have a few catering surprises.
